abstract = {Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of empirical research on neighborhoods and health. However, although the data and approaches owe much to the early contributions of demographers and population scientists, this debt is largely unrecognized. Likewise, challenges posed in the early literature remain largely unanswered. I argue that just as demographers and population scientists were pioneers in the study of neighborhoods and health, they are uniquely poised to lead the field again. Putting people into place means explaining behavior and outcomes in relation to a potentially changing local context. A more dynamic conceptualization is needed that fully incorporates human agency, integrates multiple dimensions of local social and spatial context, develops the necessary longitudinal data, and implements appropriate tools. Diverse approaches with complementary strengths will help surmount the many analytic challenges to studying the dynamics of neighborhoods and health, including agent-based microsimulation models.},

abstract = {The relationship between features of physical envi- ronments and health status has become a prominent focus of research on health and mortality. Recent inno- vation in theoretical approaches to the mechanisms linking environmentswith health, combined with more sophisticated methodological tools and data collection efforts, have spurred advances in the field of contex- tual effects research. Mounting interest in the origin of socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnic differ- ences in health has also played an important role in directing attention to broader health-relevant charac- teristics of residential contexts as possible explanations for durable health disparities. This chapter reviews the current state of knowledge on the relationship between physical features of environments and adult mortal- ity. We define the physical environment to include components of the built environment (including land use, housing, transportation, such amenities as food, activity options, and green space; and urban design and decline); climate and climate-related disasters; and air and water quality. Collectively, these aspects of the physical environment play a significant role in accounting for variability across space in patterns of adult mortality.},

The majority of studies of black segregation showed higher segregation was related to higher CVD risk, although relationships were less clear for certain outcomes. Relationships among Hispanics were more mixed and appeared to vary widely by factors such as gender, country of origin, racial identity, and acculturation.

Ranging from simple visualization to sophisticated spatial analytical techniques, these applications bring a new layer of explanation to demographic phenomena. This paper reviews demographic studies that specifically addressed space with spatial statistical models, and that focused on fertility, mortality, migration, and population models. Additionally, it summarizes different spatial datasets and software freely available, as well as the challenges that exist for the development of spatial demography applications. These challenges include confidentiality issues, scale problems, and the lack of training on spatial analysis in population centers. Although the first and second challenges involve modeling and technical solutions, the latter depends only on demographers' commitment and willingness to promote change. Several topics for future spatially focused research are also outlined. Finally, the paper makes a strong case regarding the significant contribution that spatial demography can make to the monitoring, evaluation, and implementation of population policies.},

The patterns of racial disparities in health suggest that there are multiple ways by which racism can affect health.

This recent research continues to document an inverse association between discrimination and health. This pattern is now evident in a wider range of contexts and for a broader array of outcomes. Advancing our understanding of the relationship between perceived discrimination and health will require more attention to situating discrimination within the context of other health-relevant aspects of racism, measuring it comprehensively and accurately, assessing its stressful dimensions, and identifying the mechanisms that link discrimination to health.},

abstract = {Latent Gaussian models are a common construct in statistical applications where a latent Gaussian field, indirectly observed through data, is used to model, for instance, time and space dependence or the smooth effect of covariates. Many well-known statistical models, such as smoothing-spline models, space time models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatio-temporal models, log-Gaussian Cox models, and geostatistical models are latent Gaussian models. Integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA) is a new approach to implement Bayesian inference for such models. It provides approximations of the posterior marginals of the latent variables which are both very accurate and extremely fast to compute. Moreover, INLA treats latent Gaussian models in a general way, thus allowing for a great deal of automation in the inferential procedure. The inla programme, bundled in the R library INLA, is a prototype of such black-box for inference on latent Gaussian models which is both flexible and user-friendly. It is meant to, hopefully,make latent Gaussian models applicable, useful and appealing for a larger class of users.},

We utilize the concept in a study of the daily practices of accessing food among low-income residents of the Downtown Eastside neighborhood of Vancouver, BC. We highlight how food access for the urban poor involves a complex and contradictory negotiation of both sites of encounter and care and also exclusion and regulation. Focusing on foodscapes emphasizes the social, relational, and political construction of food and thus highlights not simply food provision but also questions of existing power structures and potentialities for future change. Therefore, we discuss efforts to question the existing food system in Vancouver, to resist the gentrification processes that threaten the Downtown Eastside's food resources, and to build alternative strategies for urban food justice.},

abstract = {The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index (P̃*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index (H̃), a spatial relative diversity index (R̃), and a spatial dissimilarity index (D̃). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index P̃*—which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments—and the spatial information theory index H̃—which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual—are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

We detect early declines in some regions of the country and document large differences between early and late transitions in regard to both the initial level of fertility and the speed of the transition. We also use our results to test hypotheses regarding changes in the level of development at the onset of the fertility transition and identify a temporary stall in the Brazilian transition that occurred in the late 1990s.

We present results for aggregate property crime data as well as models for specific property crime types: residential burglary, nonresidential burglary, theft, auto theft, and arson. ESDA confirms the presence of spatial clustering of property crime and we seek to explain these patterns using spatial Poisson models implemented in WinBUGS. Our results indicate that built environment variables were significant predictors of property crime, especially the presence of a highway on auto theft and burglary.},

We examine analytically the respective omitted-variable and simultaneity biases of nonspatial OLS and spatial OLS in the simplest case and then evaluate the performance of all four estimators in bias, efficiency, and SE accuracy terms under more realistic conditions using Monte Carlo experiments. We provide empirical illustration, showing how to calculate and present spatial effect estimates effectively, using data on European governments' active labor market expenditures. Our main conclusions are that spatial OLS, despite its simultaneity, performs acceptably under low-to-moderate interdependence strength and reasonable sample dimensions. Spatial 2SLS or spatial ML may be advised for other conditions, but, unless interdependence is truly absent or minuscule, any of the spatial estimators unambiguously, and often dramatically, dominates on all three criteria the nonspatial OLS commonly used currently in empirical work in political science.},

abstract = {Area-based deprivation indices (ABDIs) have become a common tool with which to investigate the patterns and magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in health. ABDIs are also used as a proxy for individual socioeconomic status. Despite their widespread use, comparably less attention has been focused on their geographic variability and practical concerns surrounding the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) than on the individual attributes that make up the indices. Although scale is increasingly recognized as an important factor in interpreting mapped results among population health researchers, less attention has been paid specifically to ABDI and scale. In this paper, we highlight the effect of scale on indices by mapping ABDIs at multiple census scales in an urban area. In addition, we compare self-rated health data from the Canadian Community Health Survey with ABDIs at two census scales. The results of our analysis confirm the influence of spatial extent and scale on mapping population health-with potential implications for health policy implementation and resource distribution.},

abstract = {Area data are commonly used in many social science disciplines, but have a number of characteristics which have necessitated the development of specialist tools for analysis and display. In this paper we discuss the application to area data of exploratory analysis methods and visualisation techniques, and in particular the growing number of software packages which provide visualisation methods to support exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). In the exploratory analysis of non- spatial data, the data are often considered to consist of rough and smooth elements. If this idea is extended to spatial data, it can be argued that a software system for ESDA should have facilities for exploring the rough and smooth elements of both the spatial and nonspatial elements of the data. Visualisation techniques can assist with this by providing a wide range of graphical displays, in a highly interactive environment. Conceptual frameworks are developed for both ESDA and scientific visualisation, and four software packages that link graphical and cartographical views of the data are reviewed against these requirements. The packages fall into two broad groups. In one, the emphasis is on highly interactive graphics, but with few numerical methods or tools for exploring the spatial properties of the data. In the other, specialist spatial tools are provided, but the graphical tools are less flexible. It is argued that a combination of both approaches would provide a package which more fully satisfied the requirements of ESDA. The need to assess the effectiveness of different visualisation techniques in supporting and encouraging the exploratory analysis of spatial data is noted},

abstract = {A number of recent studies have used surveys of neighborhood informants and direct observation of city streets to assess aspects of community life such as collective efficacy, the density of kin networks, and social disorder Raudenbush and Sampson (1999a) have coined the term "ecometrics" to denote the study of the reliability and validity of such assessments. Random errors of measurement will attenuate the associations between these assessments and key outcomes. To address this problem, some studies have used empirical Bayes methods to reduce such biases, while assuming that neighborhood random effects are statistically independent. In this paper we show that the precision and validity of ecometric measures can be considerably improved by exploiting the spatial dependence of neighborhood social processes within the framework of empirical Bayes shrinkage. We compare three estimators of a neighborhood social process: the ordinary least squares estimator {\{}(OLS){\}}, an empirical Bayes estimator based on the independence assumption {\{}(EBE){\}}, and an empirical Bayes estimator that exploits spatial dependence {\{}(EBS).{\}} Under our model assumptions, {\{}EBS{\}} performs better than {\{}EBE{\}} and {\{}OLS{\}} in terms of expected mean squared error loss. The benefits of {\{}EBS{\}} relative to {\{}EBE{\}} and {\{}OLS{\}} depend on the magnitude of spatial dependence, the degree of neighborhood heterogeneity, as well as neighborhood's sample size. A cross-validation study using the original 1995 data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and a replication of that survey in 2002 show that the empirical benefits of {\{}EBS{\}} approximate those expected under our model assumptions; {\{}EBS{\}} is more internally consistent and temporally stable and demonstrates higher concurrent and predictive validity.

abstract = {One of the leading health mysteries in the U.S. is why the infant mortality rate is one of the highest among industrialized countries. Although the relationships of both maternal health and socioeconomic characteristics to infant mortality rates are well documented, little is known about whether the social environment is associated with infant health. Moreover, few ecological studies of infant mortality in the literature have adopted a spatial approach to handle the spatial dependence embedded in the data. This study is designed to fill these gaps by connecting the concept of social capital with infant mortality in the U.S. at the county level. In so doing, it employs a spatial Poisson methodology to manage spatial dependence. The major conclusions are: (1) Though structural social capital index alone is predictive of infant health, in spatial (SM) and in non-spatial model (NSM), in SM this effect disappears when residential stability and neighborhood safety (cognitive social capital) are included. In NSM adding cogitive SC makes all SC variables NSig. Soc Cap spatially clustered, need to model spatial effects, see why both could better explain why infant mortality varies by county. (2) The adverse effect of low birth weight on infant health clearly reduced when social capital and other socioeconomic conditions included, especially in SM. (3) Our study illustrates that a spatial approach is necessary, especially for ecological studies; otherwise, spatial dependence would lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal disease mapping comprises a wide range of models used to describe the distribution of a disease in space and its evolution in time. These models have been commonly formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework with two main approaches: an empirical Bayes (EB) and a fully Bayes (FB) approach. The EB approach provides point estimates of the parameters relying on the well-known penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) technique. The FB approach provides the posterior distribution of the target parameters. These marginal distributions are not usually available in closed form and common estimation procedures are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, the spatio-temporal models used in disease mapping are often very complex and MCMC methods may lead to large Monte Carlo errors and a huge computation time if the dimension of the data at hand is large. To circumvent these potential inconveniences, a new technique called integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), based on nested Laplace approximations, has been proposed for Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models. In this paper, we show how to fit different spatio-temporal models for disease mapping with INLA using the Leroux CAR prior for the spatial component, and we compare it with PQL via a simulation study. The spatio-temporal distribution of male brain cancer mortality in Spain during the period 1986-2010 is also analysed.},

abstract = {Although numerous studies have found a positive association between the density of alcohol establishments and various types of crime, few have examined how neighborhood attributes (e.g., schools, parks) could moderate this association. We used data from Minneapolis, MN with neighborhood as the unit of analysis (n = 83). We examined eight types of crime (assault, rape, robbery, vandalism, nuisance crime, public alcohol consumption, driving while intoxicated, underage alcohol possession/consumption) and measured density as the total number of establishments per roadway mile. Neighborhood attributes assessed as potential moderators included non-alcohol businesses, schools, parks, religious institutions, neighborhood activism, neighborhood quality, and number of condemned houses. Using Bayesian techniques, we created a model for each crime outcome (accounting for spatial auto-correlation and controlling for relevant demographics) with an interaction term (moderator × density) to test each potential moderating effect. Few interaction terms were statistically significant. The presence of at least one college was the only neighborhood attribute that consistently moderated the density-crime association, with the presence of a college attenuating the association between the density and three types of crime (assaults, nuisance crime, and public consumption). However, caution should be used when interpreting the moderating effect of college presence because of the small number of colleges in our sample. The lack of moderating effects of neighborhood attributes, except for presence of a college, suggests that the addition of alcohol establishments to any neighborhood, regardless of its other attributes, could result in an increase in a wide range of crime.},

abstract = {Background: Food store availability may determine the quality of food consumed by residents. Neighborhood racial residential segregation, poverty, and urbanicity independently affect food store availability, but the interactions among them have not been studied. Purpose: To examine availability of supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores in US census tracts according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and urbanicity. Methods: Data from 2000 US Census and 2001 InfoUSA food store data were combined and multivariate negative binomial regression models employed. Results: As neighborhood poverty increased, supermarket availability decreased and grocery and convenience stores increased, regardless of race/ethnicity. At equal levels of poverty, Black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets, White tracts had the most, and integrated tracts were intermediate. Hispanic census tracts had the most grocery stores at all levels of poverty. In rural census tracts, neither racial composition nor level of poverty predicted supermarket availability. Conclusions: Neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood poverty are independently associated with food store availability. Poor predominantly Black neighborhoods face a double jeopardy with the most limited access to quality food and should be prioritized for interventions. These associations are not seen in rural areas which suggest that interventions should not be universal but developed locally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent attempts to place individual health-related behaviour in context have been judged largely unsuccessful. This paper examines how this situation might be improved and is especially concerned with the role of quantitative methodologies. It is argued that, whilst recent developments in social theory help provide important theoretical guidelines, they can only be implemented with difficulty in empirical health-related behaviour research if traditional quantitative methodologies are used. It is suggested that the best way to implement social theory within a quantitative framework is to apply the newly developed technique of multilevel modelling. This paper offers an overview of the multilevel approach and outlines its significance for health-related behaviour research. In addition, it details a number of ways in which the multilevel framework can be extended so as to achieve further improvements in the conceptualization of health-related behaviour. To illustrate the value of the technique, the paper finishes by considering one of these extensions in detail and applying it to data recording smoking behaviour in the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {This paper explores the links between lay knowledge, place and health related social action (or agency) at the individual and collective level. It is based on an analysis of in-depth interviews and neighbourhood survey data across four localities in two cities in the North West of England. The qualitative analysis has identified 'guidelines' that we argue provide socially shared understandings of the normative contours of 'proper places' which shape the way people respond to the everyday lived reality of places. The quantitative findings suggest that a substantial minority of people, particularly in disadvantaged areas, are exposed to significant dissonance between the normative dimensions and lived experience of place. The analysis points to potential interactions between individual and collective action which may affect the health of individuals and populations and 'ontological fit' - people's ability to (re) construct a positive identity despite living in what they and others perceive to be an 'improper' place. This is linked to their biographical connections with particular places and the extent to which they can localise problems and people in places at a distance from themselves. The paper contributes to understanding about the processes that generate inequalities in the health experience of people living in sharply contrasting socio-economic circumstances as well as finer-grained health inequalities between the 'poor' and the 'poorest'. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We use national representative data ('The Housing and Living Survey', 2006) on the Netherlands with 61,235 respondents in 3273 neighborhoods. The cross-sectional data were combined with information provided by Statistics Netherlands on neighborhoods, i.e., the percentage of residents in the highest income quintile per neighborhood and the municipality's degree of urbanity. The association of neighborhood social capital with individual health was assessed by multilevel logistic regression analysis. Our results show that neighborhood social capital is positively associated with health.

Several types of empiric studies have been used to examine possible area or neighborhood effects, including ecologic studies relating area characteristics to morbidity and mortality rates, contextual and multilevel analyses relating area socioeconomic context to health outcomes, and studies comparing small numbers of well-defined neighborhoods. Strengthening inferences regarding the presence and magnitude of neighborhood effects will require addressing a series of conceptual and methodological issues. Many of these issues relate to the need to develop theory and specific hypotheses on the processes through which neighborhood and individual factors may jointly influence specific health outcomes. Important challenges include defining neighborhoods or relevant geographic areas, identifying significant area or neighborhood characteristics, specifying the role of individual-level variables, incorporating life-course and longitudinal dimensions, combining a variety of research designs, and avoiding reductionism in the way in which "neighborhood" factors are incorporated into models of disease causation and quantitative analyses.analyses.},

abstract = {The modifiable areal unit problem arises when the boundaries that define neighborhoods affect perceived levels of segregation. Scholars postulate that this problem is exacerbated when one uses a definition of neighborhoods that is based on administrative units; doing so leads to an aspatial measure of segregation, which may or may not adequately account for the spatial relationships among residential locations. In this article, we assess whether aspatial and spatial definitions of neighborhoods produce different perceived levels of income segregation. Using an original individual-level dataset on income in San Mateo County, California, we define each individual's neighborhood in three ways – two aspatial and one spatial. On the basis of these definitions of neighborhoods, we then estimate residential income segregation using the local Moran's I statistic. We report two primary findings. First, the three measures generate different perceived levels of income segregation. Specifically, we observe less income segregation when using the aspatial measures as compared with the spatial one. Second, the inconsistencies between these measures are systematic in such a way as to lead to different inferences when used to predict individual voter turnout.},

In this essay, we review the recent literature on the outcomes of urban ethnic segregation and focus on some major themes that emerge from the literature.

abstract = {Epidemiology, sociology, and geography have been successful in re-establishing interest in the role of place in shaping health and health inequalities. However, some of the relevant empirical research has relied on rather conventional conceptions of space and place and focused on isolating the "independent" contribution of place-level and individual-level factors. This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of 'place' to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates 'relational', views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, 'contextually sensitive' policy interventions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper explores the dynamics between poverty and exclusion; neighbourhood, and health and well being by considering the role of social networks and social capital in the social processes involved. It is based on qualitative research taking two deprived areas as exemplary case studies, and involving depth interviews with residents. Neighbourhood influences on networks and social capital were explored, network typologies developed reflecting structural and cultural aspects of individual's networks, and pathways implicated in health effects considered. The complexity of social capital is addressed. The role of three factors in influencing social networks and social capital are demonstrated: neighbourhood characteristics and perceptions; poverty and social exclusion, and social consciousness. Perceptions of inequality could be a source of social capital as well as demoralisation. Different network structures- dense and weak, homogeneous and heterogeneous- were involved in the creation of social capital and had implications for well being. Coping, enjoyment of life and hope are identified as benefits. Although participation in organisations was confirmed as beneficial, it is suggested that today's heterogeneous neighbourhoods also require regenerated local work opportunities to develop bridging ties necessary for the genesis of inclusive social capital and better health. Despite the capacity of social capital to buffer its harsher effects, the concept is not wholly adequate for explaining the deleterious effects of poverty on health and well being.},

Although offering the potential for new insights into how community factors impact health and well being, this research has received criticism for being undertheorized and methodologically flawed. In an effort to address some of these limitations, this paper applies Pierre Bourdieu's (1986) [Bourdieu, P. (1986). Handbook of theory and research for the sociology of education (pp. 241-258). New York: Greenwood] social capital theory to create a conceptual model of neighborhood socioeconomic processes, social capital (resources inhered within social networks), and health. After briefly reviewing the social capital conceptualizations of Bourdieu and Putnam, I attempt to integrate these authors' theories to better understand how social capital might operate within neighborhoods or local areas. Next, I describe a conceptual model that incorporates this theoretical integration of social capital into a framework of neighborhood social processes as health determinants. Discussion focuses on the utility of this Bourdieu-based neighborhood social capital theory and model for examining several under-addressed issues of social capital in the neighborhood effects literature and generating specific, empirically testable hypotheses for future research. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the past 10 years, interest in studying the relationship between area of residence and health has grown. During this period empirical relations between place and health have been observed at a variety of spatial scales, from census tracts to administrative units in metropolitan areas to whole regions, and for a variety of health outcomes. Despite the richness of the data, there are relatively few publications offering theoretical explanations for these observations, and a sound conception of place itself is still lacking. Using place as a relational space linked to where people live, work and play, this paper conceptualises the nature of neighbourhoods as they contribute to the local production of health inequalities in everyday life. In reference to Giddens' structuration theory, we propose that neighbourhoods essentially involve the availability of, and access to, health-relevant resources in a geographically defined area. Taking inspiration from the work of Godbout on informal reciprocity, we further propose that such availability and access are regulated according to four different sets of rules: proximity, prices, rights, and informal reciprocity. Our theoretical framework suggests that these rules give rise to five domains, the physical, economic, institutional, local sociability, and community organisation domains which cut across neighbourhood environments through which residents may acquire resources that shape their lifecourse trajectory in health and social functioning.},

While some argue that this awakening is refreshing and new and, in fact, long overdue, I demonstrate that spatially focused demographic theories and research agendas clearly predate contemporary interest in these topics. I assert that recent methodological advancements have merely encouraged and brought refinement to the expanding body of spatially oriented population research—research strongly rooted in demographic tradition and practice. Indeed, I make the claim that, until roughly the mid-20th century, virtually all demography in the United States (and elsewhere, but not specifically examined here) was spatial demography. Then, shortly after mid-century, a paradigm shift occurred, and the scientific study of population quickly came to be dominated by attention to the individual as the agent of demographic action. Traditional spatial demography—macro-demography— gave way to micro-demography, and, I argue, most demographers simply abandoned the data and approach of spatial demography. In closing the paper I include a brief discussion of the recent awakening that has come to spatial demographers from developments in other disciplines, principally geography, regional science, and spatial econometrics.},

abstract = {Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation has been associated with health behaviors and outcomes. However, neighborhood socioeconomic status has been measured inconsistently across studies. It remains unclear whether appropriate socioeconomic indicators vary over geographic areas and geographic levels. The aim of this study is to compare the composite socioeconomic index to six socioeconomic indicators reflecting different aspects of socioeconomic environment by both geographic areas and levels. Using 2000 U.S. Census data, we performed a multivariate common factor analysis to identify significant socioeconomic resources and constructed 12 composite indexes at the county, the census tract, and the block group levels across the nation and for three states, respectively. We assessed the agreement between composite indexes and single socioeconomic variables. The component of the composite index varied across geographic areas. At a specific geographic region, the component of the composite index was similar at the levels of census tracts and block groups but different from that at the county level. The percentage of population below federal poverty line was a significant contributor to the composite index, regardless of geographic areas and levels. Compared with non-component socioeconomic indicators, component variables were more agreeable to the composite index. Based on these findings, we conclude that a composite index is better as a measure of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation than a single indicator, and it should be constructed on an area- and unit-specific basis to accurately identify and quantify small-area socioeconomic inequalities over a specific study region.},

abstract = {We attempt to clarify a number of points regarding use of spatial regression models for regional growth analysis. We show that as in the case of non-spatial growth regressions, the effect of initial regional income levels wears off over time. Unlike the non-spatial case, long-run regional income levels depend on: own region as well as neighbouring region characteristics, the spatial connectivity structure of the regions, and the strength of spatial dependence. Given this, the search for regional characteristics that exert important influences on income levels or growth rates should take place using spatial econometric methods that account for spatial dependence as well as own and neighbouring region characteristics, the type of spatial regression model specification, and weight matrix. The framework adopted here illustrates a unified approach for dealing with these issues.},

@article{Berkman2000,
abstract = {It is widely recognized that social relationships and affiliation have powerful effects on physical and mental health. When investigators write about the impact of social relationships on health, many terms are used loosely and interchangeably including social networks, social ties and social integration. The aim of this paper is to clarify these terms using a single framework. We discuss: (1) theoretical orientations from diverse disciplines which we believe are fundamental to advancing research in this area; (2) a set of definitions accompanied by major assessment tools; and (3) an overarching model which integrates multilevel phenomena. Theoretical orientations that we draw upon were developed by Durkheim whose work on social integration and suicide are seminal and John Bowlby, a psychiatrist who developed attachment theory in relation to child development and contemporary social network theorists. We present a conceptual model of how social networks impact health. We envision a cascading causal process beginning with the macro-social to psychobiological processes that are dynamically linked together to form the processes by which social integration effects health. We start by embedding social networks in a larger social and cultural context in which upstream forces are seen to condition network structure. Serious consideration of the larger macro-social context in which networks form and are sustained has been lacking in all but a small number of studies and is almost completely absent in studies of social network influences on health. We then move downstream to understand the influences network structure and function have on social and interpersonal behavior. We argue that networks operate at the behavioral level through four primary pathways: (1) provision of social support; (2) social influence; (3) on social engagement and attachment; and (4) access to resources and material goods.},

abstract = {Although social capital has been linked to a variety of health outcomes, its association with obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study explored the relations between social capital measured at the US state and county levels and individual obesity and leisure-time physical inactivity. Individual-level data were drawn from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, while data from other surveys and administrative sources were used to construct contextual measures. Two state-level social capital scales were derived from 10 indicators and two county-level scales from five indicators. In 2-level analyses of over 167,000 adults nested within 48 states plus the District of Columbia, residence in a state above the median on one or both state social capital scales (vs. neither scale) was associated with lower relative odds of obesity and physical inactivity, controlling for individual-level covariables and state-level estimates of mean household income, the Gini coefficient, and the percentage of Black residents. In 3-level analyses, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for physical inactivity associated with residence in a county above the median on one or both county social capital scales was significantly below 1, while the association with obesity was not significant. Significantly weaker inverse ORs for the relations between state- and county-level social capital and obesity were observed among American Indians/Alaska Natives compared to Whites. Meanwhile, little support was found for mediation by social capital of the associations of urban sprawl and income inequality with obesity or physical inactivity. Overall, this study provides some evidence for the promotion of social capital as a potential strategy for addressing the burgeoning obesity epidemic. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Social capital has been linked to health outcomes, though there are some inconsistencies in the research and the link is dependent on the measures of social capital and health used. In this paper, we argue that social capital is multifaceted and its relationship with health is complex. We explore the relationship between a number of elements of neighbourhood life and neighbourhood-based social capital, and health, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The paper reports on a study of the Western suburbs of Adelaide and the analysis of 2400 questionnaires and 40 in-depth interviews. A partial least-square path analysis was undertaken with the questionnaire data. It considered the impact of perceptions of the physical environment, neighbourhood connections, neighbourhood trust, reciprocity, perceived safety and local civic action, and a number of demographic variables, on physical and mental health as measured by the SF-12. Of the neighbourhood-related variables, only perceived neighbourhood safety was related to physical health, with neighbourhood safety and neighbourhood connections related to mental health. Of the demographic variables, higher-income level and educational achievement were related to better physical and mental health. In addition, physical health was lower and mental health higher within older age groups. The inter-relationships between the neighbourhood variables and demographic differences in experience of neighbourhood were also examined. The thematic analysis of the interviews linked a number of social aspects of neighbourhood, the physical neighbourhood environment, perceptions of safety, civic activities and availability of local services, to health outcomes. The paper concludes that there is a need for more complex measures of social capital and that socio-economic factors are of relatively greater importance in determining health.},

abstract = {This paper derives several lagrange multiplier (LM) tests for the panel data regression model with spatial error correlation. These tests draw upon two strands of earlier work. The first is the LM tests for the spatial error correlation model discussed in Anselin (Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Rao's score test in spatial econometrics, J. Statist. Plann. Inference 97 (2001) 113) and Anselin et al. (Regional Sci.

Econometrics 54 (1992) 95). The idea is to allow for both spatial error correlation as well as random region effects in the panel data regression model and to test for their joint significance. Additionally, this paper derives conditional LM tests, which test for random regional effects given the presence of spatial error correlation. Also, spatial error correlation given the presence of random regional effects. These conditional LM tests are an alternative to the one-directional LM tests that test for random regional effects ignoring the presence of spatial error correlation or the one-directional LM tests for spatial error correlation ignoring the presence of random regional effects. We argue that these joint and conditional LM tests guard against possible misspecification. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to study the performance of these LM tests as well as the corresponding likelihood ratio tests. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {After decades of epidemiological exploration into individual-level risk factors for ill health, a recent surge of interest in the health effects of socially patterned attributes of geographically defined 'places' has given the structural side of the agency-structure debate new prominence in population health research. Utilizing two original data sets, one pertaining to features of communities in British Columbia, Canada and the other to characteristics of individuals living in them, this article distinguishes the health effects of socially patterned attributes of communities, including the social capital of communities, from the health effects of characteristics of residents that contribute to social capital, e.g., trust and participation in voluntary associations. Results from multilevel analysis demonstrated that, of three different individual-level measures of health and well-being (and including measures of long-term limiting illness and self-rated health), only a measure of depressive symptoms had variability that could be reasonably attributed to the level of the community. The social capital of communities in the form of the availability of public spaces explained some of this variability, but in the direction contrary to expectations. Overall, location (community of residence) did little to explicate health inequalities in this context. The strongest predictors of health in multivariate and multilevel models were characteristics of individual survey respondents, namely, income, trust in politicians and governments, and trust in other members of the community. Breadth of participation in networks of voluntary association was not significantly related to health in multivariate models.},

These and other applications in health geography that have invoked complexity theory are examined in the paper.

Associational involvement and overweight status (assessed by body-mass score) were weakly but significantly related after controlling for the other variables; involvement had relationships with self-rated health and emotional distress before but not after controlling for socio-economic status, health behaviours and coping skills. Relationships between neighbourhood of residence and two health outcomes, self-rated health and overweight status, were statistically significant before and after controlling for the other characteristics of respondents; neighbourhood of residence was not a significant predictor of number of chronic conditions and emotional distress in multivariate models. The neighbourhood and associational involvement relationships with health were not dependent upon one another, suggesting that neighbourhood of residence did not help to explain the positive health effects of this particular measure of social capital. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Several empirical studies have suggested that neighborhood characteristics influence health, with most studies having focused on neighborhood deprivation or aspects of the physical environment, such as services and amenities. However, such physical characteristics are not the only features of neighborhoods that potentially affect health. Neighborhoods also matter because of the nature of their social organization. This study examined social capital as a potential neighborhood characteristic influencing health. Using a cross-sectional study design which linked counts of death for persons 45-64 years by race and sex to neighborhood indicators of social capital and poverty for 342 Chicago neighborhoods in the USA, we tested the ecological association between neighborhood-level social capital and mortality rates, taking advantage of the community survey data collected as part of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. We estimated a hierarchical generalized linear model to examine the association of race and sex specific mortality rates to social capital. Overall, neighborhood social capital - as measured by reciprocity, trust, and civic participation - was associated with lower neighborhood death rates, after adjustment for neighborhood material deprivation. Specifically, higher levels of neighborhood social capital were associated with lower neighborhood death rates for total mortality as well as death from heart disease and "other" causes for White men and women and, to a less consistent extent, for Blacks. However, there was no association between social capital and cancer mortality. Although, the findings from this study extend the state-level findings linking social capital to health to the level of neighborhoods, much work remains to be carried out before social capital can be widely applied to improve population health, including establishing standards of measurement, and exploring the potential "downsides" of social capital. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We conducted a detailed healthful foods market basket survey and developed an index of store cost based on the USDA Thrifty Food Plan. Using this index, we estimated the difference in street-network distance between the nearest low-cost grocery store and the nearest grocery store irrespective of cost. Spatial regression of this metric in relation to income, poverty, and gentrification at the census tract scale lead to a new theory regarding food access in the urban landscape. Food deserts are sparse in Portland, but food mirages are abundant, particularly in gentrifying areas where poverty remains high. In a food mirage, grocery stores are plentiful but prices are beyond the means of low-income households, making them functionally equivalent to food deserts in that a long journey to obtain affordable, nutritious food is required in either case. Results suggested that evaluation of food environments should, at a minimum, consider both proximity and price in assessing healthy food access for low-income households. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Five main points are noted. First, contrary to the suggestion made in several recent studies, the income inequality parameter is observed to be quite robust and carries statistical significance in mortality equations estimated from several observation sets and a fairly wide variety of specificational choices. Second, the evidence does not indicate that significance of income inequality is lost when education variables are included. Third, similarly, the income inequality parameter shows significance when a race variable is added, and also when both race and urbanization terms are entered. Fourth, while poverty is seen to have some mortality-increasing consequence, the role of income inequality appears stronger. Fifth, income inequality retains statistical significance when a quadratic income term is added and also if the log-log version of a fairly inclusive model is estimated. I therefore suggest that the recent skepticism articulated by several scholars in regard to the robustness of the income inequality parameters in mortality equations estimated from the US data should be reconsidered.},

Proximity to urban agglomeration is measured in terms of both distances to higher tiered areas in the urban hierarchy and proximity to market potential (MP). Particular attention is paid to whether periodic changes and trends in underlying conditions (e.g. technology or transport costs) have altered PopGr patterns in the hinterlands and small urban centers. Over the period 19502000, we find strong negative growth effects of distances to higher tiered urban areas, with significant, but lesser effects of distance to MP. Further, the costs of distance, if anything, appear to be increasing over time, consistent with a number of recent theories stressing the effect of new technology on the spatial distribution of activity in a mature urban system.},

abstract = {Neighbourhood research has been growing steadily over the past two decades across the social sciences, and, in particular in the area of public health. Despite this increase, there is currently no consensus on which measure and data source researchers should use to assess neighbourhood attributes. In the past, researchers have relied on census data and household surveys to assess neighbourhood conditions, but in recent years, neighbourhood observations have become a popular alternative method for characterizing neighbourhood environments. Rooted in sociology of crime research, observations are conducted by trained observers who use a checklist to observe and rate neighbourhoods on a number of conditions such as physical (e.g., traffic volume, housing conditions) and social (e.g., presence of people, gang activity) attributes. While this methodology has been gaining momentum in recent years, notably absent from the literature is a review to examine this methodology in detail. The purpose of the present study was to examine research that has used neighbourhood observations as a method. We do so by critically reviewing 51 English language studies published from 1990 onward paying particular attention to the areas of (1) methodological rigor (i.e. how observations are carried out in the field and how data are analyzed), (2) geographical boundaries (i.e. how neighbourhoods and areas of observation are spatially defined), and (3) the relationship between neighbourhood observations and residents' health (i.e. how studies examine and analyze the link between observed neighbourhood attributes and health). We find that little attention is given to details of neighbourhood observations as a method. Further, there is wide variability in how observations are conducted and analyzed making it impossible to confidently compare findings across studies. We see this review as a first step in developing sound observational measures of neighbourhood factors and conclude by providing recommendations for researchers undertaking neighbourhood observations in the future. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study applies recently developed techniques of spatial analysis to explain intercounty variation in homicide rates at four time points between 1960 and 1990. The data for the homicide rates were constructed for U.S. counties (N = 3,085) from the National Center for Health Statistics mortality files and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER system. A combination of exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial economic techniques, including Moran's I statistic (Cliff {\&} Ord, 1981), were used. Homicide is not randomly distributed in space. Throughout the 1960 to 1990 period, county-level homicide rates exhibited appreciable positive spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, a distinctive regional imprint for this spatial autocorrelation emerged. Counties in the South had higher than average homicide rates than those from statistically significant clusters. The South and the non-South constitute two distinct spatial regimes in the geographic clustering of homicide. Spatial clustering was also found to persist even after controlling for the widely recognized structural predictors of homicide, suggesting that homicide rates are not generated solely by internal structural factors. Significant regional differences in the effects of structural predictors were also found. Homicide researchers should attend to these patterns of spatial distribution to estimate the effects of nonspatial variables, and to identify potential sites for substantively interesting processes, such as diffusion. The application of spatial econometrics offers promising opportunities for expanding our understanding of how social forces contribute to interpersonal violence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic and healthcare indicators are major determinants of health outcomes. The impact of social and healthcare inequalities on Brazilian morbidity and mortality indicators is of concern but it is not well studied. METHODS: A multilevel ecological study was performed in order to investigate the association between a set of socioeconomic and healthcare indicators and five morbidity and mortality outcomes. Datasets were presented at three hierarchical levels: local (lower level), regional (intermediate level) and state (higher level). A Poisson regression model was estimated for each outcome with random intercept and fixed regression coefficients for independent variables at the three levels. The magnitude of outcome variability at intermediate and higher levels was assessed for all models. RESULTS: All outcomes were associated with both socioeconomic and healthcare variables, with predominance of associations at the local level. General and high-complexity healthcare infrastructures were directly associated with indicators related to later stages of the demographic and epidemiological transition process. A mild effect on morbidity and mortality related to political voting patterns was found at the local level. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare conditions and socioeconomic indicators are associated with health outcomes in a complex way at the local level in Brazil, but part of the variability of health outcomes is related to factors operating at higher levels. Some possible interaction effects and cross-sectional design limitations of this study must be considered.},

Various frequentist approaches have been suggested for the detection of "clusters" within a hypothesis testing framework. Unfortunately, these suffer from a number of drawbacks including the difficulty in specifying a p-value threshold at which to call significance, the inherent multiplicity problem, and the possibility of multiple clusters. In this paper, we suggest a Bayesian approach to detecting "areas of clustering" in which the study region is partitioned into, possibly multiple, "zones" within which the risk is either at a null, or non-null, level. Computation is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo, tuned to the model that we develop. The method is applied to leukemia data in upstate New York.},

Nevertheless, segregation is still higher for African Americans than for the other groups across all measures. Latinos are generally the next most highly segregated group, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders and then American Indians and Alaska Natives. Asians and Pacific Islanders and Hispanics both tended to experience increases in segregation over the period, though not across all dimensions.

We calculate an environmental Gini coefficient using Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data from 2000 to 2008. Our findings suggest Puerto Rico has a relatively constant and unequal distribution of releases over this time period. Based on this result, we investigate linkages between toxic releases and several socioeconomic and demographic indicators. We apply a quantile regression model using TRI data and American Community Survey data from 2005 to 2008 to identify important indicators across the distribution of releases. We find municipios (legal division equivalent to US counties) that have a higher percent of non-Puerto Rican Hispanic origin or high school educated population experience higher releases to all media. This also is true for unemployment, but only for municipios with the largest releases (i.e., highest quintile). The results also reveal municipios that are more densely populated or that have a higher percent of college degrees experience lower releases to all media. Higher proportions of certain age groups also suggest lower releases. These results are not constant across the distribution of releases; they are most significant in those municipios with the largest releases. This is even more obvious when we only examine releases to air. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

This article reports a contextual analysis of social capital and individual self-rated health, with adjustment for individual household income, health behaviors, and other covariates. METHODS: Self-rated health ("Is your overall health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?") was assessed among 167,259 individuals residing in 39 US states, sampled by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Social capital indicators, aggregated to the state level, were obtained from the General Social Surveys. RESULTS: Individual-level factors (e.g., low income, low education, smoking) were strongly associated with self-rated poor health. However, even after adjustment for these proximal variables, a contextual effect of low social capital on risk of self-rated poor health was found. For example, the odds ratio for fair or poor health associated with living in areas with the lowest levels of social trust was 1.41 (95{\%} confidence interval = 1.33, 1.50) compared with living in high-trust states. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous findings on the health advantages stemming from social capital.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of populations has long been a central focus of demographic inquiry. Structured patterns in spatial distribution are evident from the highest levels of macrospatial scale (e.g., global, national, and regional urban systems) to ‘‘fine-grained'' patterns in metropolitan areas (e.g., central cities, suburbs, neighborhoods, and blocks) and nonmetropolitan hinterlands (e.g., towns, villages, and hamlets). The task of documenting and explaining these patterns has occupied the attention of sociologists, economists, and geographers, and their efforts have established a body of knowledge that is impressive for its cumulative nature, rigorous theoretical underpinnings, and extensive evidentiary base. Without question, the dominant feature of spatial distribution in the United States and other developed countries is the concentration of population in densely settled urban areas. Not only do metropolitan centers contain the greatest share of the population in developed countries, these centers also exert influence over life in nonmetropolitan and rural areas. This occurs to such a degree that it is difficult to classify a significant portion of the population in a country such as the United States as nonurban in the sense that term would have evoked just a century ago. If nonurban is taken to mean populations living in low-density, small-scale communities that are largely selfsufficient in economic organization and substantially closed in terms of social organization, then nonurban populations are rare in developed countries. The daily rhythms of social and economic life of the vast majority of the population are fundamentally organized by, and integrated with, social and economic activity in metropolitan centers. Accordingly, this chapter focuses primarily on inter- and intrametropolitan spatial distribution. The chapter is also restricted to developed countries. It will not review the patterns and trends of urban and spatial distribution in developing countries, which easily could be the object of a separate paper.},

abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is a well-recognized concern for observational data in general, and more specifically for spatial data in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with spatially autocorrelated random effects are a potential general framework for handling these spatial correlations. However, as the result of statistical and practical issues, such GLMMs have been fitted through the undocumented use of procedures based on penalized quasi-likelihood approximations (PQL), and under restrictive models of spatial correlation. Alternatively, they are often neglected in favor of simpler but more questionable approaches. In this work we aim to provide practical and validated means of inference under spatial GLMMs, that overcome these limitations. For this purpose, a new software is developed to fit spatial GLMMs. We use it to assess the performance of likelihood ratio tests for fixed effects under spatial autocorrelation, based on Laplace or PQL approximations of the likelihood. Expectedly, the Laplace approximation performs generally slightly better, although a variant of PQL was better in the binary case. We show that a previous implementation of PQL methods in the R language, glmmPQL, is not appropriate for such applications. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of a bootstrap procedure for correcting the small sample bias of the tests, which applies also to non-spatial models.},

abstract = {The number of applications of spatial demography has been growing mostly since the 1990s. Ranging from simple visualization to sophisticated spatial analytical techniques, these applications bring a new layer of explanation to demographic phenomena. This paper reviews demographic studies that specifically addressed space with spatial statistical models, and that focused on fertility, mortality, migration, and population models. Additionally, it summarizes different spatial datasets and software freely available, as well as the challenges that exist for the development of spatial demography applications. These challenges include confidentiality issues, scale problems, and the lack of training on spatial analysis in population centers. Although the first and second challenges involve modeling and technical solutions, the latter depends only on demographers' commitment and willingness to promote change. Several topics for future spatially focused research are also outlined. Finally, the paper makes a strong case regarding the significant contribution that spatial demography can make to the monitoring, evaluation, and implementation of population policies.},

The results suggest that the size and locations of the detected clusters are sensitive to the chosen parameters of each method. Results also vary among the methods. We thus recommend to apply multiple different cluster detection methods to the same data and to look for commonalities between the results.

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

The USDA's Food Stamp Program (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - SNAP) is the largest food assistance program in the United States with over 40 million participants. This paper employed systematic realist review methods to determine whether participation in the Food Stamp Program causes obesity and the causal pathways through which this relationship may exist. Findings indicate a more consistent positive relationship for women than for men, especially for women who are long term users of the program. All studies discussed the "food stamp cycle" and an "income effect" as explanations for the role of food stamps in increased obesity yet evidence for these factors is limited. Curiously, the research in this field does not address obesogenic environments and we suggest that the absence of an understanding of household behavior in local contexts is a significant impediment to the reform of the Food Stamp Program. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These general points are illustrated by identifying 10 common conceptions of rural America that reflect both its social and economic diversity and its changing spatial and social boundaries. Here we emphasize symbolic and social boundaries—the distinctions between urban and rural communities and people and the processes by which boundaries are engaged. Placing behaviors or organizational forms along a rural-urban continuum (or within a metropolitan hierarchy of places) or drawing sharp rural-urban distinctions seems increasingly obsolete or even problematic.

A search of the literature published since the mid-1970s (under the MEDLINE key words, "social ties," "social network," "social isolation," "social environment") presented strong evidence that social integration leads to reduced mortality risks, and to a better state of mental health. The evidence on physical health outcomes is less conclusive. There is no consistent evidence that social integration affects the incidence of disease (at least for cardiovascular outcomes). However, social integration does appear to have a highly beneficial effect on post-myocardial infarction prognosis (functioning and longevity). A physiologic basis for these effects on health outcomes is also indicated by research demonstrating that both social isolation and nonsupportive social interactions can result in lower immune function and higher neuroendocrine and cardiovascular activity while socially supportive interactions have the opposite effects. In conclusion, available data suggest that, although social integration is generally associated with better health outcomes, the quality of existing ties also appears to influence the extent of such health benefits. Clearly, individuals' networks of social relationships represent dynamic and complex social systems that affect health outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor dietary patterns and obesity, established risk factors for chronic disease, have been linked to neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood minority composition, and low area population density. Neighborhood differences in access to food may have an important influence on these relationships and health disparities in the U.S. This article reviews research relating to the presence, nature, and implications of neighborhood differences in access to food.

METHODS: A snowball strategy was used to identify relevant research studies (n=54) completed in the U.S. and published between 1985 and April 2008.

RESULTS: Research suggests that neighborhood residents who have better access to supermarkets and limited access to convenience stores tend to have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. Results from studies examining the accessibility of restaurants are less consistent, but there is some evidence to suggest that residents with limited access to fast-food restaurants have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. National and local studies across the U.S. suggest that residents of low-income, minority, and rural neighborhoods are most often affected by poor access to supermarkets and healthful food. In contrast, the availability of fast-food restaurants and energy-dense foods has been found to be greater in lower-income and minority neighborhoods.

CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disparities in access to food are of great concern because of their potential to influence dietary intake and obesity. Additional research is needed to address various limitations of current studies, identify effective policy actions, and evaluate intervention strategies designed to promote more equitable access to healthy foods.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are a popular tool to describe the pattern of disease counts. They are usually formulated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with latent Gaussian model. So far, computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo mechanisms have been used for parameter estimation which might also induce a large Monte Carlo error. An alternative method using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) has recently been proposed. A major advantage of INLA is that it returns accurate parameter estimates in short computational time. Additionally, the deviance information criterion is provided for Bayesian model choice. This paper describes how several parametric and nonparametric models and extensions thereof can be fitted to space-time count data using INLA. A particular emphasis is given on the appropriate choice of linear constraints to ensure identifiability of the parameter estimates. The models are applied to counts of Salmonellosis in cattle reported to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office 1991-2008.},

abstract = {Reducing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic environmental health disparities requires a comprehensive multilevel conceptual and quantitative approach that recognizes the various levels through which environmental health disparities are produced and perpetuated. We propose a conceptual framework that incorporates the micro level, contained within the local level, which in turn is contained within the macro level. We discuss the utility of multilevel techniques to examine environmental level (both physical and social) and individual-level factors to appropriately quantify and improve our understanding of environmental health disparities. We discuss the reasoning and the methodological approach behind multilevel modeling, including differentiating between individual and contextual influences on individual outcomes. Next we address the questions and principles that guide the choice of levels or geographic units in multilevel studies. Finally, we address the ways in which different data sources can be combined to produce suitable data for multilevel analyses. We provide some examples of how such data sources can be linked to create multilevel data structures, and offer suggestions to facilitate the integration of multilevel techniques in environmental health disparities research and monitoring.},

abstract = {For the confirmatory factor model a series of inequalities is given with respect to the mean square error (MSE) of three main factor score predictors. The eigenvalues of these MSE matrices are a monotonic function of the eigenvalues of the matrix “ p = ¦ 1/2 › p [variant prime] ¨ p -1 › p ¦ 1/2 . This matrix increases with the number of observable variables p . A necessary and sufficient condition for mean square convergence of predictors is divergence of the smallest eigenvalue of “ p or, equivalently, divergence of signal-to-noise (Schneeweiss {\&} Mathes, 1995). The same condition is necessary and sufficient for convergence to zero of the positive definite MSE differences of factor predictors, convergence to zero of the distance between factor predictors, and convergence to the unit value of the relative efficiencies of predictors. Various illustrations and examples of the convergence are given as well as explicit recommendations on the problem of choosing between the three main factor score predictors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence linking aspects of social capital to health and wellbeing outcomes, in particular to reducing health inequities, has led to intense interest in social capital theory within public health in recent decades. As a result, governments internationally are designing interventions to improve health and wellbeing by addressing levels of social capital in communities. The application of theory to practice is uneven, however, reflecting differing views on the pathways between social capital and health, and divergent theories about social capital itself. Unreliable implementation may restrict the potential to contribute to health equity by this means, yet to date there has been limited investigation of how the theory is interpreted at the level of policy and then translated into practice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The paper outlines a collaborative research project designed to address this knowledge deficit in order to inform more effective implementation. Undertaken in partnership with government departments, the study explored the application of social capital theory in programs designed to promote health and wellbeing in Adelaide, South Australia. It comprised three case studies of community-based practice, employing qualitative interviews and focus groups with community participants, practitioners, program managers and policy makers, to examine the ways in which the concept was interpreted and operationalized and identify the factors influencing success. These key lessons informed the development of practical resources comprising a guide for practitioners and briefing for policy makers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall the study showed that effective community projects can contribute to population health and wellbeing and reducing health inequities. Of specific relevance to this paper, however, is the finding that community projects rely for their effectiveness on a broader commitment expressed through policies and frameworks at the highest level of government decision making. In particular this relationship requires long term vision, endorsement for cross-sectoral work, well-developed relationships and theoretical and practical knowledge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Attention to the practical application of social capital theory shows that community projects require structural support in their efforts to improve health and wellbeing and reduce health inequities. Sound community development techniques are essential but do not operate independently from frameworks and policies at the highest levels of government. Recognition of the interdependence of policy and practice will enable government to achieve these goals more effectively.},

abstract = {Rural areas of the United States tend to have higher obesity rates than urban areas, particularly in regions with high proportions of non-white residents. This paper analyzes the effect of fast-food availability on the level of fast-food consumption and obesity risk among both white and non-white residents of central Texas. Potential endogeneity of fast-food availability is addressed through instrumental variables regression using distance to the nearest major highway as an instrument. We find that non-whites tend to exhibit higher obesity rates, greater access to fast-food establishments and higher consumption of fast-food meals compared to their white counterparts. In addition, we found that whites and non-whites respond differently to the availability of fast-food in rural environments. Greater availability is not associated with either greater consumption of fast-food meals or a higher obesity risk among the sample of whites. In contrast, greater availability of fast-food is positively associated with both the number of meals consumed for non-white rural residents and their obesity. While our results are robust to specification, the effect of availability on weight outcomes is notably weaker when indirectly calculated from the implied relationship between consumption and caloric intake. This highlights the importance of directly examining the proposed mechanism through which an environmental factor influences weight outcomes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
